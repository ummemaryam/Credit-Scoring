# Credit Scoring Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts the likelihood of a person defaulting on their credit payment within 2 years using machine learning model.

# Project Overview
The model predicts **credit default risk** (SeriousDlqin2yrs = 1) based on customer financial data such as:
- Age  
- Debt Ratio  
- Number of past due payments (30‚Äì59, 60‚Äì89, 90+ days)  
- Number of Dependents  

The pipeline includes:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  
4. Model training with:
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
5. Model evaluation using ROC-AUC  
6. Interactive interface using **Gradio**

# Dataset

cd credit-scoring-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Main Files
File	Description
credit_scoring_sample.csv	Input dataset
credit_scoring_model.py	Model training and evaluation script
best_credit_model.pkl	Saved trained model
scaler.pkl	Saved scaler
app.py	Gradio interface for real-time prediction

# How to Run
1) Train the model
python credit_scoring_model.py
This trains the models and saves the best one (best_credit_model.pkl).

2) Launch Gradio interface
python app.py
Then open the local URL shown in your terminal to test predictions interactively.
